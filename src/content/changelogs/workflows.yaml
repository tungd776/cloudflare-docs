    title: "Workflows is now in public beta!"
    description: |-
      Workflows, a new product for building reliable, multi-step workflows using Cloudflare Workers, is now in public beta. The public beta is available to any user with a [free or paid Workers plan](/workers/platform/pricing/).

      A Workflow allows you to define multiple, independent steps that encapsulate errors, automatically retry, persist state, and can run for seconds, minutes, hours or even days. A Workflow can be useful for post-processing data from R2 buckets before querying it, automating a Workers AI RAG pipeline, or managing user signup flows and lifecycle emails.

      You can learn more about Workflows in [our announcement blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-workflows-durable-execution-on-workers/), or start building in our [get started guide](/workflows/get-started/guide/).
