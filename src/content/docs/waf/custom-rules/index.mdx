Custom rules are evaluated in order, and some actions like _Block_ will stop the evaluation of other rules. For more details on actions and their behavior, refer to the [actions reference](/ruleset-engine/rules-language/actions/).

:::note[Did you migrate from Cloudflare Firewall Rules?]

Refer to the [migration guide](/waf/reference/migration-guides/firewall-rules-to-custom-rules/#main-differences) to learn more about the differences between firewall rules and custom rules.
:::

To define sets of custom rules that apply to more than one zone, use [custom rulesets](/waf/account/custom-rulesets/), which require an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.
