# Pricing

:::note

Workflows is included in both the Free and Paid [Workers plans](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers).

:::

Workflows pricing is identical to [Workers Standard pricing](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) and are billed on two dimensions:

* **CPU time**: the total amount of compute (measured in milliseconds) consumed by a given Workflow.
* **Requests** (invocations): the number of Workflow invocations. [Subrequests](/workers/platform/limits/#subrequests) made from a Workflow do not incur additional request costs.

A Workflow that is waiting on a response to an API call, paused as a result of calling `step.sleep`, or otherwise idle, does not incur CPU time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Frequently asked questions related to Workflows pricing:

### Are there additional costs for Workflows?

No. Workflows are priced based on the same compute (CPU time) and requests (invocations) as Workers.

### Are Workflows available on the [Workers Free](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) plan?

Yes.

### How do Workflows show up on my bill?

Workflows are billed as Workers, and share the same CPU time and request SKUs.

### Are there any limits to Workflows?

Refer to the published [limits](/workflows/reference/limits/) documentation.
