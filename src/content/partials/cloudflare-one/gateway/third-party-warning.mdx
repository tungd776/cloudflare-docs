Gateway will not properly filter traffic sent through third-party VPNs or other Internet filtering software, such as [iCloud Private Relay](https://support.apple.com/102602). To ensure your DNS policies apply to your traffic, Cloudflare recommends turning off software that may interfere with Gateway.

To turn off iCloud Private Relay, refer to the Apple user guides for [macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-icloud-private-relay-mchlecadabe0/) or [iOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/protect-web-browsing-icloud-private-relay-iph499d287c2/).
